# Virtual Drill Sergeant

Wouldn't it be cool if a DS could text you throughout the day to help you stay
in shape?


## User Manual

There is a bank of commands that will be issued at random.  Commands may be
disabled through the web interface.



## Wishlist


* Control over which commands are issued
  select screen to decide on exercises I'd like to see that I can change at any
  time

* More flexibility over scheduling (ex: every 30 minutes after 6 pm)

* Hierarchy or categorization of commands
  exercise type and severity




* Use shortened urls in text messages.
* Make it easier to mark a command as completed.
  text back a word to mark complete
* segment log by days
* share db across lambda functions to run locally
* Use CloudFormation to create a stack for this.  This will help me learn AWS
    and possibly allow for whitelabeling this idea.
