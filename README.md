# Virtual Drill Sergeant

Wouldn't it be cool if a DS could text you throughout the day to help you stay
in shape?



## Wishlist

* Better record of commands executed - workaround: copy messages from iMessage
* Easier scheduling - workaround: add/remove the # before the crontab line
* Interactivity
* Update web client to get current status
