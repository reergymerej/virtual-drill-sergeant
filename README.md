# Virtual Drill Sergeant

Wouldn't it be cool if a DS could text you throughout the day to help you stay
in shape?


## Wishlist

* Provide a way in the client to mark a command as completed.

  add to ui

* Use CloudFormation to create a stack for this.  This will help me learn AWS
    and possibly allow for whitelabeling this idea.




* confirm when a command is finished
* log only finished commands
* segment log by days
* log events by phone number
* turn notifications on/off by phone number
* share db across lambda functions to run locally
