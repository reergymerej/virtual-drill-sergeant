# Virtual Drill Sergeant

Wouldn't it be cool if a DS could text you throughout the day to help you stay
in shape?


## Wishlist

* Make it easier to mark a command as completed.
  text back or click a link in the message

* segment log by days
* share db across lambda functions to run locally
* Use CloudFormation to create a stack for this.  This will help me learn AWS
    and possibly allow for whitelabeling this idea.
