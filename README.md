# Virtual Drill Sergeant

Wouldn't it be cool if a DS could text you throughout the day to help you stay
in shape?


## User Manual

There is a bank of commands that will be issued at random.  Commands may be
disabled/enabled through the web interface.

A log of commands issued is shown on.  To mark an activity as complete, click
the "finish" button or click the "complete" link in the text message.

When new commands are created, they are not added to your rotation unless you
explicitly opt-in.


## Problems
  "providerResponse": "Phone is currently unreachable/unavailable",

  How do we get around this?


## Wishlist

* Provide some sort of goals or benchmarks or something so you can see your
improvement over time.

* Add some way for the commands to increase in intensity over time.

* I want to group commands so I can turn the groups on/off easily.

* Add a way to provide feedback/wishlist/problems in the UI for easy feedback.

* Separate dev/prod environments.

* Hierarchy or categorization of commands
  exercise type and severity

* More flexibility over scheduling (ex: every 30 minutes after 6 pm)

* Use shortened urls in text messages.

* Make it easier to mark a command as completed.
  text back a word to mark complete

* segment log by days

* Use CloudFormation to create a stack for this.  This will help me learn AWS
    and possibly allow for whitelabeling this idea.
